What is DAO?

DAO (Data Access Object) is an object design pattern to differentiate how the
data is being processed, in simple terms, to separate the business logic and the
programming logic.

The audience of a token is the intended recipient of the token. The audience value is a string -- typically, the base address of the resource being accessed,
such as https://contoso.com . The client_id in OAuth refers to the client application that will be requesting resources from the Resource Server.

Implicit/Widening casting = casting from a shorter range to a wider range e.g. from short to int
Explicit/Shortening casting = casting from a wider range to a shorter range

Spring @Value annotation is used to assign default values to variables and method arguments.
